# StayFi

### RWA + DePIN: Tokenized Vacation Rentals with Decentralized Service Networks

$680B market. 1000x cost reduction. First-mover on Solana state compression.

**Raising:** $2M seed | **Valuation:** $10M

---

# The Convergence Play

**RWA Problem:** $100K minimum for real estate investment
**DePIN Problem:** Service providers wait 30-60 days for payment
**Platform Problem:** Airbnb extracts 15% + property managers 25% = 40% value lost

## Our Solution: Property Tokenization + Service Network + Viral Rewards

- **Fractional ownership from $100** (RWA)
- **Instant USDC payments to cleaners** (DePIN)  
- **TRIP tokens convert guests → owners** (Network Effects)

**Result:** 5% fees vs 15%, 400x LTV/CAC, decentralized operations

# 1000x Infrastructure Advantage

## State Compression on Solana = Category Creation

| Metric | Competitors (ETH/Polygon) | StayFi (Solana) | Moat |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------|------|
| **Cost per property** | $2,000 | $2 | **1000x cheaper** |
| **Service payment** | $5-50 | $0.002 | **Enables micropayments** |
| **Minimum viable property** | $100K | $10K | **10x more inventory** |

**13M+ devices in DePIN globally. 0 using state compression for RWA.**

We can tokenize a parking spot profitably. They can't tokenize a mansion.

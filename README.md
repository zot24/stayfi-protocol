## Overview

StayFi revolutionizes hospitality by enabling fractional ownership of vacation rentals through blockchain technology. This front-end prototype demonstrates our three-token ecosystem (STAY governance, Property ownership, TRIP rewards) that turns guests into investors.

### üöÄ Core Innovation

- **10x Better Economics**: 5% platform fee vs 15% industry standard
- **1000x Lower Costs**: State compression on Solana enables micro-transactions
- **100x More Accessible**: $100 minimum vs $100K+ traditional real estate
- **Instant Liquidity**: Trade property tokens 24/7 on DEXs
- **Viral Growth Engine**: TRIP loyalty tokens create participant ‚Üí owner funnel

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions that enhance the demo experience:

- **UI/UX improvements**: Better visualizations, animations
- **Documentation**: Clarify complex concepts
- **Testing**: Increase coverage, add E2E tests
- **Features**: New demo scenarios that showcase the protocol

For protocol design discussions, please open a GitHub Discussion first.

## üîí Security & Disclaimer

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is a demonstration prototype only**

- No real blockchain integration
- No actual payments processed

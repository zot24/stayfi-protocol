# Who is this for?

StayFi serves multiple audiences across the hospitality and finance stack. Below are the key groups and short messages adapted from the investor pitch.

## VCs

"StayFi gamifies hospitality through TRIP tokens. Every action - booking, reviewing, cleaning - earns tokens convertible to property ownership. It's like airline miles that turn into equity. The dopamine hit of earning TRIP creates a viral loop where guests become investors, leading to 10x higher LTV at 1/5 the CAC."

## Property Owners

"Turn your Airbnb into tokens. Get paid upfront for 30% of your property value while keeping 70% of future revenue. We handle everything."

## Retail Investors

"Own pieces of Miami beach condos, Buenos Aires apartments, or Bali villas for $100. Earn daily rental income. Sell anytime on exchanges."

## Partners (Service Providers & Ops)

"Join our service network. Get paid instantly in USDC. No platform commissions. Build portable on-chain reputation."

## Guests & Travelers

"Book Stays, Earn Ownership"

"Every time you book through StayFi, you get loyalty tokens that can be converted to property ownership. Stay 10 nights, own a piece forever. Plus it's 10% cheaper than Airbnb because we only take 5% fees. Your stays literally build your real estate portfolio."

# StayFI: The Ownership Layer for Global Hospitality

## The Opportunity

The $680B short-term rental market is broken. Airbnb extracts 15% in fees. Property investment requires $100K+ minimums. Service providers wait 30-60 days for payment. We're fixing all of this.

## Our Solution

**StayFI** enables anyone to invest $100 in tokenized vacation rentals and earn daily yields. We combine:

- **RWA Tokenization**: Fractional property ownership starting at $100
- **DePIN Network**: Decentralized cleaners and property managers
- **TRIP Rewards**: Loyalty tokens that convert to ownership

## How It Works

1. Properties are tokenized into $100 fractions
2. Investors buy tokens, receive daily rental income
3. Guests book stays 10% cheaper than Airbnb
4. Service providers get instant payment
5. Everyone earns TRIP tokens → converts to ownership

## Traction & Metrics

- **Current**: 1 pilot property, 10 angel investors, $100K committed
- **Q1 2026**: 10 properties, 100 investors, $1M raised
- **Year 2 Target**: 100 properties, $50M GMV, 10,000 investors

## Technology Advantage

Built on Solana with state compression = 1000x cost reduction

- Storage cost: $0.002 vs $2 per booking
- Transaction fee: $0.00025 vs $5-50
- Confirmation: 0.4 seconds vs 12+ seconds

## Business Model

- **5% platform fee** (vs Airbnb's 15%)
- **0.3% trading fees** on property tokens
- **$2.3K revenue per $200K property annually**
- **Break-even**: Q2 2028 with 1000 properties

## Token Economics

**Three tokens working in harmony:**

- **STAY**: Governance & staking (1B fixed supply)
- **Property Tokens**: Fractional ownership per property
- **TRIP**: Loyalty rewards convertible to ownership

**Viral Growth Engine**: 1.4x viral coefficient through TRIP rewards

- Book → Earn TRIP → Review → Share → Refer → Invest → Evangelize

## Team & Ask

- **CEO**: 20+ years engineering, based Paraguay/Argentina
- **Seeking**: CTO (Solana expert), Head of Ops (hospitality veteran)
- **Raising**: $2M seed at $10M valuation
- **Use of Funds**: 40% product, 30% first properties, 30% ops/legal

## Why Now?

- Post-COVID travel boom (revenge travel)
- Crypto adoption in LATAM at all-time high
- Solana makes micro-transactions finally viable
- No competitor has RWA + DePIN + viral rewards

## The Vision

We're not disrupting Airbnb - we're building the infrastructure for people to **own** the next Airbnb. Every guest becomes an investor. Every cleaner becomes a stakeholder. Every booking builds wealth for the community, not corporations.

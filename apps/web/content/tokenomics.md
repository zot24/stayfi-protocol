# StayFI Tokenomics Deep Dive

## The Three-Token Ecosystem Engineering Wealth Creation

---

## Executive Summary

StayFI's tokenomics creates a self-reinforcing ecosystem where every participant action increases network value. Through three synergistic tokens—STAY (governance), Property Tokens (ownership), and TRIP (rewards)—we align incentives across guests, hosts, investors, and service providers. This document details the mathematical models, economic mechanisms, and game theory underlying our token design.

## 1. Token Overview

### 1.1 The Trinity Model

```
STAY (Governance) ←→ Property Tokens (Ownership) ←→ TRIP (Engagement)
         ↑                      ↑                         ↑
         └──────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
                        Value Accrual Loop
```

| Token | Type | Supply | Primary Function | Value Driver |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **STAY** | SPL (Fungible) | 1B Fixed | Governance & Staking | Protocol Revenue |
| **Property** | SPL (Unique/Property) | Variable | Fractional Ownership | Rental Yield |
| **TRIP** | SPL (Soulbound→Liquid) | Unlimited | Loyalty & Rewards | Network Activity |

### 1.2 Token Interactions

```python
# Simplified token interaction model
def token_ecosystem_value():
    stay_value = f(protocol_revenue, staking_rate, governance_premium)
    property_value = f(rental_yield, appreciation, liquidity_premium)
    trip_value = f(redemption_options, network_growth, tier_benefits)
    
    # Synergistic effects
    network_value = stay_value * property_value * trip_value
    return network_value
```

## 2. STAY Token Economics

### 2.1 Distribution Schedule

| Allocation | Amount | Vesting | Unlock Schedule |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Community Rewards** | 400M (40%) | 5 years | Linear daily |
| **Team** | 200M (20%) | 4 years | 1-year cliff, then linear |
| **Investors** | 180M (18%) | 2 years | 6-month cliff, then linear |
| **Treasury** | 170M (17%) | DAO-controlled | As needed |
| **Initial Liquidity** | 50M (5%) | None | Day 1 |

### 2.2 Supply Dynamics

```
Year 0: 230M circulating (23%)
Year 1: 380M circulating (38%)
Year 2: 530M circulating (53%)
Year 3: 680M circulating (68%)
Year 4: 830M circulating (83%)
Year 5: 1B circulating (100%)
```

### 2.3 Value Accrual Mechanisms

**1. Buyback & Burn**

```
Protocol Revenue = Booking Fees + Trading Fees
Buyback Amount = 40% of Protocol Revenue
Monthly Buyback = $50K (Year 1) → $200K (Year 2) → $800K (Year 3)

Deflationary Pressure = (Buyback Volume / Circulating Supply) * 12
Expected Annual Reduction: 2-5% of supply
```

**2. Staking Rewards**

```
Base APY = 8%
Staking Multipliers:
- 3-month lock: 1.2x (9.6% APY)
- 6-month lock: 1.5x (12% APY)
- 12-month lock: 2x (16% APY)

Expected Staking Rate: 30-40% of supply
Supply Reduction Effect: -30-40% liquid supply
```

**3. Utility Demand**

```
Required STAY for:
- Property listing: 1,000 STAY/property
- Service provider: 500 STAY minimum
- Governance participation: 100 STAY minimum
- Fee discounts: 10,000 STAY for 50% discount

Utility Lock-up: ~50M STAY (5% of supply)
```

### 2.4 Price Model

```python
def stay_price_model(year):
    # Base value from revenue
    revenue = protocol_revenue(year)
    revenue_multiple = 30  # DeFi protocol average
    base_value = revenue * revenue_multiple
    
    # Staking adjustment
    staking_rate = 0.35  # 35% staked
    staking_multiplier = 1 / (1 - staking_rate)
    
    # Burn adjustment
    burn_rate = 0.02  # 2% annual burn
    burn_multiplier = (1 + burn_rate) ** year
    
    # Network effects
    metcalfe_law = (users ** 2) / 1000000
    
    market_cap = base_value * staking_multiplier * burn_multiplier * metcalfe_law
    price = market_cap / circulating_supply(year)
    
    return price

# Projected prices
Year 1: $0.02 (4x from seed)
Year 2: $0.10 (20x from seed)
Year 3: $0.50 (100x from seed)
```

## 3. Property Token Economics

### 3.1 Tokenization Model

**Each Property:**

```
Property Value: $200,000
Token Supply: 2,000 tokens
Price per Token: $100

Distribution:
- Public Sale: 1,800 tokens (90%)
- Liquidity Pool: 200 tokens (10%)
- Platform Fee: 2% of raise ($4,000)
```

### 3.2 Yield Generation

```python
def property_token_yield(property_value, location, management_quality):
    # Base yield from market
    market_cap_rate = location_factor * 0.12  # 12% base
    
    # StayFI optimization
    platform_efficiency = 1.15  # 15% better than traditional
    occupancy_boost = 1.10  # 10% higher via network effects
    
    # Service quality multiplier
    service_multiplier = management_quality  # 0.8 to 1.2
    
    gross_yield = market_cap_rate * platform_efficiency * occupancy_boost * service_multiplier
    
    # Deduct expenses
    platform_fee = 0.05  # 5%
    service_costs = 0.15  # 15%
    
    net_yield = gross_yield * (1 - platform_fee - service_costs)
    
    return net_yield  # Expected: 10-15% APY
```

### 3.3 Liquidity Dynamics

**Automatic Market Making:**

```
Each Property Pool:
- Token Reserve: 200 property tokens
- USDC Reserve: $20,000
- Initial Price: $100
- Pool Type: Constant Product (x*y=k)

Price Discovery:
P_new = P_old * (1 + Δ_demand - Δ_supply)

Liquidity Incentives:
- LP rewards: 50 STAY per $1000 liquidity/month
- Trading fees: 0.3% to LPs
- Expected LP APY: 25-35%
```

### 3.4 Secondary Market Pricing

```python
def property_token_price(base_price, metrics):
    # Fundamental value
    dcf_value = calculate_dcf(rental_income, growth_rate, discount_rate)
    
    # Liquidity premium (vs traditional RE)
    liquidity_premium = 1.15  # 15% for instant trading
    
    # Platform growth multiple
    network_multiple = 1 + (platform_growth_rate * 0.5)
    
    # Sentiment factor
    sentiment = analyze_social_metrics()  # -0.2 to +0.2
    
    market_price = dcf_value * liquidity_premium * network_multiple * (1 + sentiment)
    
    return max(market_price, base_price * 0.9)  # 10% floor protection
```

---

## 4. TRIP Token Economics

### 4.1 Emission Schedule

```python
def trip_emissions(month):
    # Base emissions
    base_rate = 100000  # 100K TRIP/month
    
    # Growth factor
    growth = 1.1 ** (month / 12)  # 10% annual increase
    
    # Activity multiplier
    activity = network_activity_score()  # 0.5 to 2.0
    
    monthly_emissions = base_rate * growth * activity
    
    # Distribution
    guest_rewards = monthly_emissions * 0.40
    host_rewards = monthly_emissions * 0.20
    service_rewards = monthly_emissions * 0.20
    community_rewards = monthly_emissions * 0.20
    
    return {
        'total': monthly_emissions,
        'guest': guest_rewards,
        'host': host_rewards,
        'service': service_rewards,
        'community': community_rewards
    }
```

### 4.2 Conversion Mechanics

```
Conversion Rates (Dynamic):
1000 TRIP → 1 STAY (adjusts with STAY price)
5000 TRIP → $100 property token voucher
500 TRIP → 1% fee discount (max 50%)
100 TRIP → Priority booking slot

Vesting Schedule:
Days 0-90: Soulbound (non-transferable)
Days 91-365: Convertible but not tradeable
Day 366+: Fully liquid (if approved by DAO)
```

### 4.3 Tier System Economics

| Tier | TRIP Required | Benefits | Expected Users | Value/User |
|------|---------------|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Bronze** | 0-999 | Base rewards | 70% | $50 |
| **Silver** | 1000-4999 | 1.2x multiplier, 4.5% fees | 20% | $200 |
| **Gold** | 5000-19999 | 1.5x multiplier, 4% fees | 8% | $500 |
| **Platinum** | 20000+ | 2x multiplier, 3% fees, exclusive properties | 2% | $2000+ |

### 4.4 Psychological Value Drivers

```python
def trip_perceived_value(user_profile):
    # Objective value
    redemption_value = trip_balance * conversion_rate
    
    # Subjective multipliers
    status_value = tier_level * social_visibility * 100
    progress_value = (trip_to_next_tier / trip_earned) * 50
    loss_aversion = expiry_pressure * 200
    endowment_effect = time_held * 0.1
    
    # Gamification bonus
    achievement_value = badges_earned * 25
    streak_value = consecutive_days * 10
    
    total_perceived_value = (
        redemption_value +
        status_value +
        progress_value +
        loss_aversion +
        endowment_effect +
        achievement_value +
        streak_value
    )
    
    return total_perceived_value  # Often 2-3x redemption value
```

## 5. System-Wide Economic Model

### 5.1 Revenue Flow Waterfall

```
Guest Payment ($100)
│
├─→ Property Token Holders: $80 (80%)
│   ├─→ Distributed pro-rata daily
│   └─→ Compounds to 10-15% APY
│
├─→ Service Providers: $15 (15%)
│   ├─→ Property Manager: $9 (60%)
│   ├─→ Cleaner: $4.50 (30%)
│   └─→ Maintenance Reserve: $1.50 (10%)
│
└─→ Protocol Treasury: $5 (5%)
    ├─→ STAY Buyback: $2 (40%)
    ├─→ Development: $2 (40%)
    └─→ Insurance: $1 (20%)
```

### 5.2 Network Value Equation

```python
def stayfi_network_value(t):
    # Metcalfe's Law component
    users = user_growth(t)
    network_effect = users ** 2
    
    # Revenue component
    gmv = booking_volume(t)
    revenue = gmv * 0.05  # 5% take rate
    revenue_multiple = 30  # Industry multiple
    
    # Asset component
    properties = property_count(t)
    avg_property_value = 200000
    asset_value = properties * avg_property_value * 0.1  # Platform stake
    
    # Token velocity adjustment
    stay_velocity = 4  # Turns per year
    trip_velocity = 12  # Monthly redemption
    property_velocity = 0.5  # Long-term holds
    
    weighted_velocity = (
        (stay_mcap / stay_velocity) +
        (trip_mcap / trip_velocity) +
        (property_mcap / property_velocity)
    ) / total_mcap
    
    network_value = (
        (network_effect / 1000000) *
        (revenue * revenue_multiple) +
        asset_value
    ) / weighted_velocity
    
    return network_value
```

### 5.3 Equilibrium Analysis

**Nash Equilibrium Points:**

1. **Staking Equilibrium**: 35% STAY staked
   - Below 35%: Rewards attract stakers
   - Above 35%: Opportunity cost too high

2. **Liquidity Equilibrium**: 10% of property tokens in pools
   - Below 10%: LP rewards increase
   - Above 10%: Impermanent loss dominates

3. **Service Provider Equilibrium**: 1 provider per 5 properties
   - Below ratio: Income attracts providers
   - Above ratio: Competition reduces income

### 5.4 Risk Scenarios

**Stress Test Models:**

```python
def stress_test(scenario):
    scenarios = {
        'bear_market': {
            'booking_decline': -50%,
            'token_price_drop': -80%,
            'result': 'Protocol survives on 2.5% fees'
        },
        'regulatory_shock': {
            'property_freeze': True,
            'pivot': 'Focus on existing property yield',
            'result': 'Revenue continues from current portfolio'
        },
        'competition': {
            'fee_war': 2.5%,
            'response': 'Superior tokenomics maintain advantage',
            'result': 'Network effects prevent exodus'
        },
        'hack': {
            'loss': '$5M',
            'insurance_fund': '$10M',
            'result': 'Full user compensation, reputation intact'
        }
    }
    
    return analyze_impact(scenarios[scenario])
```

## 6. Game Theory Analysis

### 6.1 Participant Strategies

**Investor Optimal Strategy:**

```
1. Buy property tokens in growing tourist areas
2. Provide liquidity for 30% of holdings
3. Stake remaining STAY for 12 months
4. Reinvest yields into new properties
ROI: 35-45% APY
```

**Guest Optimal Strategy:**

```
1. Book all travel through StayFI
2. Leave detailed reviews with photos
3. Refer friends for bonus TRIP
4. Convert TRIP → Property tokens at 5000
5. Become investor earning from others
Savings: 10% on bookings + ownership upside
```

**Service Provider Optimal Strategy:**

```
1. Stake minimum 500 STAY
2. Maintain 4.8+ rating
3. Accept all tasks within 5 minutes
4. Upload before/after photos
5. Build reputation for premium properties
Income: $3000-5000/month
```

### 6.2 Attack Vectors & Defenses

| Attack | Method | Defense | Economic Cost |
|--------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Sybil Attack** | Create fake accounts for TRIP | KYC for conversions | $10 per account |
| **Review Farming** | Fake bookings for reviews | Booking verification | $50 per fake booking |
| **Wash Trading** | Inflate property token volume | 0.3% trading fee | Loss on each trade |
| **Governance Attack** | Buy 51% of STAY | Would cost $50M+ | Economically irrational |

## 8. Growth & Sustainability

### 8.1 Flywheel Effects

```
More Properties → More Guests → More Reviews → Better SEO →
More Bookings → Higher Yields → More Investors → More Capital →
More Properties (Cycle Repeats)

Velocity increases 20% per cycle
Time per cycle: 3 months
Expected 10x growth per year
```

### 8.2 Long-term Equilibrium

**Year 5 Steady State:**

- 10,000 properties ($2B in assets)
- 1M users (100K investors, 900K guests)
- $500M GMV annually
- $25M protocol revenue
- $750M total market cap
- STAY price: $0.75 (150x from seed)

### 8.3 Sustainability Metrics

```python
def sustainability_score():
    # Revenue sustainability
    revenue_per_property = 2300  # Annual
    break_even_properties = 1000
    current_properties = 1500
    revenue_health = current_properties / break_even_properties  # 1.5
    
    # Token sustainability  
    emission_rate = 0.10  # 10% inflation
    burn_rate = 0.02  # 2% deflation
    net_inflation = emission_rate - burn_rate  # 8%
    token_health = 1 / (1 + net_inflation)  # 0.93
    
    # Network sustainability
    user_retention = 0.60  # 60% annual
    user_acquisition = 0.40  # 40% growth
    network_health = user_retention + user_acquisition  # 1.0
    
    overall_sustainability = (
        revenue_health * 0.4 +
        token_health * 0.3 +
        network_health * 0.3
    )
    
    return overall_sustainability  # 1.15 (healthy)
```

## 9. Conclusion

StayFI's three-token model creates multiple reinforcing loops that drive value to all participants. The combination of:

1. **STAY** for governance and value accrual
2. **Property Tokens** for real yield generation
3. **TRIP** for viral growth and retention

...produces network effects that compound exponentially. Each token serves a distinct purpose while strengthening the others, creating a resilient ecosystem that becomes more valuable with every participant and transaction.

The math is clear: **$2M seed investment → $750M network value in 5 years (375x)**.

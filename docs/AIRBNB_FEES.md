# what are the airbnb fees for real

Airbnb fees for 2025 have recently changed, moving to a single standardized fee structure for hosts. Most hosts now pay a 15.5% service fee on the booking subtotal, with guests no longer charged a separate service fee during checkout; the full price is shown upfront to the guest before booking.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

### Host Fee Structure

- Hosts pay a 15.5% service fee on the booking subtotal (includes nightly rate plus fees like cleaning, but excludes taxes). Hosts with listings in Brazil pay 16%.[^2][^5][^4]
- This model is mandatory for most hosts globally starting December 1, 2025, and applies especially to those using property management software.[^6][^5][^1]
- For example, if the nightly rate is \$200 and cleaning fee is \$50, the host pays 15.5% of \$250, which amounts to \$38.75. The guest sees and pays \$250 at checkout.[^7][^2]


### Guest Fee Changes

- Guests no longer pay a service fee separately; the price they see is the final price (excluding taxes if applicable).[^3][^5][^2]


### Previous Split-Fee Model (Now Discontinued)

- Previously, fees were split: hosts paid only 3% and guests paid between 14.1% and 16.5%. This split model has now ended for all hosts by December 2025, replaced by the host-only fee model.[^8][^9][^4][^2]


### Additional Airbnb Fees (Still Possible)

- Cleaning fees: Set by the host, vary per listing.
- Extra guest fees, pet fees, and damage deposits: Applied at host discretion and shown in the breakdown at booking.[^10]
- Cancellation fees (both host and guest side): Depend on booking policies.[^10]


### Exceptions

- Hosts in Brazil: 16% service fee.[^5][^2]
- Airbnb Experiences and Services have their own separate fees, often around 15% with a minimum.[^11]

Airbnb’s latest move is intended to simplify fee transparency and guest understanding. The host-only fee structure replaces the previous split model and affects nearly all hosts by the end of 2025, except for limited regional exceptions.[^4][^1][^2][^3]
